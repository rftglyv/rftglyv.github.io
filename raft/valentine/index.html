                    <p class="card-text">Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Jupiter, being the biggest planet, gets its name from the king of the ancient Roman gods.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to. While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar system. There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly be supported.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball. From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes Sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The largest and most powerful hurricanes ever recorded on Earth spanned over 1,000 miles across with winds gusting up to around 200 mph. That’s wide enough to stretch across nearly all U.S. states east of Texas. But even that kind of storm is dwarfed by the Great Red Spot, a gigantic storm in Jupiter. There, gigantic means twice as wide as Earth. With tumultuous winds peaking at about 400 mph, the Great Red Spot has been swirling wildly over Jupiter’s skies for the past 150 years—maybe even much longer than that.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Jupiter’s so-called ‘string of pearls’ on Jupiter is a series of massive counterclockwise rotating storms that appear as white ovals in the gas giant's southern hemisphere. Since 1986, these white ovals have varied in number from six to nine.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Jupiter is best known for its colorful storms. But also has some of the most vivid auroras. Not only are the auroras bigger than Earth, they are also hundreds of times more energetic than auroras on our home world. And, unlike those on Earth, they never cease. On Earth the most intense auroras are caused by solar storms, but Jupiter generates its own. The strong magnetic field of the gas giant grabs charged particles from its surroundings, including particles thrown into space by its orbiting moon Io, known for its numerous and large volcanoes.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Jupiter is called a gas giant planet. Its atmosphere is made up of mostly hydrogen gas and helium gas, like the sun. The planet is covered in thick red, brown, yellow and white clouds. The clouds make the planet look like it has stripes. The reasons for the rich detail and colors and swirls of are currently unknown.</p>
